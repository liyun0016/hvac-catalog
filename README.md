# HVAC Product Catalog Interface

## 📦 Data Sources & Structure

All HVAC data in this project was collected by scraping official manufacturer websites to ensure accuracy and freshness.

✅ Source Websites

Data was gathered from the following brand websites:

Carrier: "https://www.carrier.com/residential/en/us/products/heating-cooling/"

Trane: "https://www.trane.com/residential/en/products/"

Lennox: "https://www.lennox.com/residential/products/heating-cooling"

Rheem: "https://www.rheem.com/products/residential/heating-and-cooling/"

Goodman: "https://www.goodmanmfg.com/products/residential-products#HeatingandCooling"

Daikin:"https://daikincomfort.com/products/heating-cooling/whole-home-systems"

York: "https://www.york.com"

Amana: "https://www.amana-hac.com/products"

American Standard: "https://www.americanstandardair.com/products/#heating-cooling"

Bryant: "https://www.bryant.com/en/us/products/"

✅ Data Structure

Each brand's data was normalized into a consistent tabular format with the following columns:

```bash 
product_line_name, product_line_image, model_name, model_image, efficiency
```

✅ Processing

CSVs were grouped by product_line_name and models using pandas.
Missing fields (NaN) were cleaned and replaced with blank strings.
Final output was converted into a unified JSON file (hvacData.js) structured by:
brand → productLines → models
This makes the data easy to use and render in the frontend application.


## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the HVAC catalog application locally.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hvac-catalog.git 
cd hvac-catalog
```

2.  Install Frontend Dependencies

## 🖱️ Usage and Features

Once the application is running, users can explore HVAC systems through a clean, multi-level interface:

🔍 Navigation Flow

- Home Page: Displays a list of HVAC brands, each with a logo.

- Brand Page: Shows available product lines (e.g. Air Conditioners, Heat Pumps).

- Product Line Page: Lists all models under the selected product line.

- Model Page: Displays product image, model name, and efficiency (e.g., SEER2).

- Model Detail Page (in progress): Placeholder for future specs, manuals, and advanced details.


🔎 Search Functionality

- A search bar is available on each page (brands, lines, models).

- Case-insensitive: Typing `york`, `YORK`, or `YoRk` works the same.

- Flexible input: You don't need to type from the beginning — searching `ork` will still find `York`.

- Filtering updates results in real time as you type.


↩️ Back Navigation

- A clickable breadcrumb path is shown under the search bar.

- Users can quickly go back to the previous level (brand or product line) by clicking the appropriate segment.
